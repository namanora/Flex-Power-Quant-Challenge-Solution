def compute_total_volume(side: str) -> float:
    """
    Compute total traded volume for a given side.

    Input:
      side: "buy" or "sell" to specify which side of the orderbook to sum.
    Algorithm:
      1) Issue a single SQL query to sum the `quantity` column for rows matching `side`.
      2) Use COALESCE to return 0 if there are no matching rows.
      3) Fetch the result and coerce it to float.
    Returns:
      Total volume (in MW) as a float.

# ### Define PnL function 

# All computations are done in SQL directly for better performance and lower memory usage.

# In[ ]:


def compute_pnl(strategy_id: str) -> float:
    """
    Compute total Profit & Loss for a given strategy in one SQL call.

    Input:
      strategy_id: string identifier of the trading strategy to evaluate.
    Algorithm:
      1) Use a SQL CASE expression to treat sells as +quantity*price and buys as â€“quantity*price.
      2) SUM over all trades for that strategy and COALESCE to 0 if no trades exist.
      3) Execute the query and fetch the single PnL value.
    Returns:
      Total PnL (in euros) as a float.
